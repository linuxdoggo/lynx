# Lynx

this is a custom image based on fedora-bootc that comes preinstalled with niri, noctalia and a sane config to use this shell properly

## how to install

currently the only way to install is to rebase from an existing fedora atomic install, i personally recommend Fedora Silverblue since elements of gnome are used in this setup, but if you know what you're doing any atomic install will work as a basis

```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/linuxdoggo/lynx
```
